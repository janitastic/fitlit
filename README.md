### Project Overview:
   Our group was given a basic code foundation to add to in order to create an interactive fitness tracker that allows a user to track their lifestyle activities over several categories including water intake, amount and quality of sleep, and physical activity.
    We accomplished this by applying our accumulated knowledge of Front End Engineering combined with a variety of newly introduced concepts such as Webpack, network requests and responses, 3rd party NPM dependencies, and Test Driven Development using the  Mocha and Chai.

### Functionality:
   With the Fitlit application, the user can keep track of a multitude of health and fitness metrics. Widgets will display a visual representation of the user's daily and weekly water intake, daily step goal and their average step goal of their community, as well as the measurements of their daily and weekly hours slept and sleep quality.    
   In a further extension of the application the user will also be able to, by selection of a specific date or week using an integrated calendar, visualize detailed measurements of their physical activity, including miles walked, flights of stairs climbed and total minutes active.
